  Why did I create this mod?
</summary>

- For Windows/linux, there is no reason for this mod, but there is no console log in BombSquad Android, so I made this, it helps me a lot because there is no way to know my errors when I use Android

- If you want to use it - use it,  if you don't, it's not my problem
